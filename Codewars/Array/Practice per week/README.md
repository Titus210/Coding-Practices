## Problem
Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to practice a lot of problems.<br/>
Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.  <br/>
Chef decides to solve at least 10 problems every week for 4  weeks. <br/>

Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over 4 weeks as an array <br/>
output the number of weeks in which Chef met his target. <br/>
