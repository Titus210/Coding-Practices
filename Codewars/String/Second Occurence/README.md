# Problem: Find the index of the second occurrence of a letter in a string
***
In this kata, you need to write a function that takes a string and a letter as input and then returns the index of the second occurrence of that letter in the string. <br/>
If there is no such letter in the string, then the function should return -1. If the letter occurs only once in the string, then -1 should also be returned.
