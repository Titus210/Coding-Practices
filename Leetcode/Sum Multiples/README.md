# Sum Multiples
***

## Problem Statement
Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.

Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.

## Example
### Example 1:
Input:
```7
```

Output:
```
21
```
### Explanation:
Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.

Your Task
